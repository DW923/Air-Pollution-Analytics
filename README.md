# Air-Pollution-Analytics
R programming scripts for Air Pollution Analytics and Forecasting

Steps to run the code
1. Create API keys on data.gov.in and OpenWeather Air Pollution API
2. Use the fetch_data.R script (using appropriate API keys) to fetch the data for the region that you would like (In this code coordinates of Tamil Nadu have been used) (Optional - can use Geocoding API to generate coordinates instead of manually inputting them)
3. After generating data, use the clean_data.R script to preprocess the data into a consistent format
4. Run the App.R script to start the Shiny dashboard for interactive visualization
